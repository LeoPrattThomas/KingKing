### Basic Overview of Game

Objective: 
No real objective, just play with friends on an (maybe infinite) map.
</summary>
When you load/spawn into the game, you will be surrounded by “castle walls” (will decide area of walls and the chunk formatting later) with a tiny army of 100 men (ai in the game - the tiny characters like your army we’ll call them meeples - don't need to look good, just a rough pixelated form of a human like this, 웃 for beginning of game.) Players are able to make their own sort of government like democracy or communism. Each government has its own separate color. Communism could have color red and democracy might have color blue. Shades of color (red or blue as of now) will fill in all territory owned by that player lightly. When the player is looking Color is only shown on the mini map and is light, not hard. To the player on screen, you can not see shading. Players can interact with each other by forming treaties and going to war. Background of the game doesn’t have to be anything special. Just a simple texture for grass, forests, and rock looks.

The Beginnings:
</summary>
I have some ideas for the geographical objects on the map, like rivers, mountains, and heat/cold. When beginning in your world you spawn on a random point in the map far away from anybody's kingdom. You could wander around but the minimap (I assume there will be one) is shrouded in mist. Similarly to Kingdoms and castles, there would be fertility and resource outcrops. To start your kingdom you would plant down a flag and claim the land. (The map would probably be split into squares or hexagons) Next, you build your keep. Wherever your keep is that is your capital. After building up your first city you could send out scouts that cost people, food, and materials and they would explore a section of the mist around you. The farther away from a city you send them to explore the more resources it costs. People could die on these trips and they would take time to complete. It is also much more expensive to send scouts over mountains and rivers. You can only make settlements a certain distance away from other cities and must be on scouted and claimed land. Scouting and claiming are different things. To make a settlement you would click a button on the screen select an area that follows the rules above and then a UI will show up stating what resources this would take. The farther away it is and the geography around it would change this. Also if you have a big enough city suburbs will spawn around it and grow on their own. Also, I think you shouldn't build every house and shop but like city skylines zone the area in your city and place more important buildings. When you have an army they will consume food and charge money for upkeep. When moving them over distances they will also waste resources. If you order them to march through a river or mountain they will consume much more and there is a chance of people dying. Also in wartime to encourage big battles instead of many little ones, only you (or maybe player generals?) can move units and you have a small range. (Because radios don't exist.) You can also seige a city where you stop anything from going in or out of the walls. People coming into your kingdom will be intermittent this means that you might get a large migration or just a few wanderers. If you know of another kingdom and you have more wealth or better living style people might immigrate from theirs to yours. Also if you run out of food or have very low happiness you won't just lose. You will lose population en mass and sometimes peasant units will form and attack your buildings.
